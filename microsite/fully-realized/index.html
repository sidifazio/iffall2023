The story follows a group of middle school girls, led by protagonist Madoka Kaname, who make supernatural contracts to become magical girls. In battling surreal enemies known as witches, they learn of the anguish and peril associated with their new roles. The first ten episodes of the series aired on TBS and MBS between January and March 2011, while the final two episodes were delayed until April of the same year due to the T<span class="accent">ō</span>hoku earthquake and tsunami.
